I called Microsoft and here was there solution that worked. To restore a database with only single MDF and no transaction log:


Rename current_database.mdf to current_database.mdf .old Create New Database with same name as old unavailable database Open SQLServer Properites, Server Settings tab
    Set Server Properites to "ALLOW MODIFICATIONS TO BE MADE DIRECTLY TO THE SYSTEM"
Run this Query
update sysdatabases
set status = 32768
where name='database_name'
Stop/Start SQL Server
Database should appear in "Emergency Mode"
Then IMPORT Database and all objects into a NEW database Drop the Database which is in EMERGENCY MODE Rename NEW database to desired database name
